# SVM Decision Boundary Visualization on Breast Cancer Dataset

This project demonstrates the application of Support Vector Machines (SVM) for binary classification using the Breast Cancer dataset. It includes model training with both linear and RBF kernels, visualization of decision boundaries, hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation using cross-validation.

## Features

- Load and preprocess the Breast Cancer dataset
- Train SVM models with linear and RBF kernels
- Visualize decision boundaries in 2D using PCA
- Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV
- Evaluate model performance with cross-validation

## Dataset

The project uses the [Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29) (provided as `breast-cancer.csv`).
